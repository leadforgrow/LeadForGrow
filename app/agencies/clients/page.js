          <h2>The "Agency Tab" Problem: Why You're Losing 10 Hours a Week</h2>
          <p>
            The old way of managing multiple clients in an agency in India involves a spreadsheet of passwords, 50 open Chrome tabs, and constant context-switching. You log out of Client A's WordPress, log into Client B's CRM, check Client C's WhatsApp group, and repeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>This inefficiency is the silent killer of agency profit margins.</strong> LeadForGrow's multi-tenant architecture was built to eliminate this friction. We provide a single master dashboard where you can toggle between 5, 50, or 500 client accounts in two clicks—no logout required.

          <h2>Operational Excellence Through High-Level Oversight</h2>
          <p>
            As an agency owner, you need to know which client accounts are healthy and which need attention. LeadForGrow's centralized management platform provides an "Agency Scorecard" that gives you the bird's-eye view you've been missing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead Velocity Audit:</strong> See which clients are getting the most enquiries and which campaigns need optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Response Time Monitoring:</strong> Track how fast each client's sales team (or your own fulfillment team) is responding to hot leads.</li>
            <li><strong>System Health Check:</strong> Ensure that every form, automation, and funnel is functional across your entire client portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Know where your team is spending the most time and adjust their workload to maximize agency efficiency.</li>
          </ul>
