      q: "Can I use my own custom domain?",

      q: "How does the native lead capture work?",

          <h2>The Problem with "Online Brochures"</h2>
          <p>
            In today's fast-paced digital economy, having a "pretty" website isn't enough. Most business owners and agencies in India make the mistake of building an online brochure—a site that tells people who they are but never asks them for an enquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a potential client visits your site, they are usually looking for a solution to a problem. If your site doesn't immediately show them how you solve it and provide a clear, friction-free way to contact you, they will leave and never come back. This is known as "Visitor Leakage," and it's costing you money every hour.
          </p>

          <h2>LeadForGrow: Engineered for Capture, Not Just Design</h2>
          <p>
            We realized that high-performance teams don't have time to wait 4 weeks for a developer to change a button or launch a landing page. That's why we built the LeadForGrow Funnel & Website Builder. It's designed to bring the power of top-tier conversion rate optimization (CRO) to your fingertips.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our builder doesn't start with a blank white page; it starts with <strong>proven frameworks</strong>. Whether you need an appointment booking funnel for a hospital, a lead gen site for a real estate agent, or a multi-client portal for your agency, we have the blueprint ready for you.

          <h3>Why Our Builder Outperforms WordPress and Wix</h3>
          <p>
            While generic builders are great for personal blogs, they lack the specialized infrastructure needed for serious lead generation. Here is how LeadForGrow gives you the edge:

          <h2>Empowering Indian Agencies to Scale Fulfillment</h2>
          <p>
            For agencies, the bottleneck is often fulfillment. Building a custom site for every new client is a massive time-sink. With LeadForGrow, you can create <strong>Snapshots</strong>—templated funnels that you can deploy for a new client in under 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows you to scale from managing 5 clients to 50 clients without increasing your headcount. You provide a world-class technology stack to your clients, branded as your own, and focus on what truly matters: generating results.
