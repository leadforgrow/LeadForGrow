          <h2>The "Marketing Blind Spot": Why Impressions Don't Pay Bills</h2>
          <p>
            Most business owners and agencies in India are flying blind. They see "Clicks" and "Impressions" on their Google Ads dashboard, but they have no idea if those clicks ever turned into a real inquiry or, eventually, a closed deal. This is the marketing blind spot, and it's where profitable businesses go to die.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>LeadForGrow Analytics brings 100% transparency to your sales funnel.</strong> We believe you shouldn't just track traffic; you should track revenue. Our simple yet powerful reporting suite bridges the gap between your marketing spend and your actual sales outcomes.

            If you're still using Excel to calculate your ROI, you're already behind. LeadForGrow's visual reporting engine processes your data in real-time, giving you a daily "Growth Scorecard" that tells you exactly how your business is performing:

            <li><strong>The Speed Metric:</strong> Monitor your team's average response time. If it's over 5 minutes, you're losing money—our system highlights exactly where.</li>
            <li><strong>The Conversion Ratio:</strong> Know which sales rep has the highest closing rate and which marketing channel produces the highest 'quality' lead.</li>
            <li><strong>The ROI Truth:</strong> Finally answer the question: "Is my marketing budget actually bringing in more revenue than it costs?"</li>
