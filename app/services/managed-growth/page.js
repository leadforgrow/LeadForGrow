          <h2>The "Founder's Trap": When Tech Stalls Your Growth</h2>
          <p>
            In the early stages of a business in India, the founder does everything. You set up the website, you manage the ads, you follow up the leads. But as you scale toward ₹1Cr, ₹5Cr, and beyond, this DIY approach becomes your biggest bottleneck. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Growth requires specialization.</strong> Every hour you spend fixing a tracking pixel or mapping CRM fields is an hour you aren't spending on high-level strategy or closing massive deals. LeadForGrow Managed Growth allows you to delegate the entire technical sales operation to a team of experts who eat, sleep, and breathe lead generation.
